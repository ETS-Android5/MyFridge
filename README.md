App Description: Creating an app that helps keep track of items in refrigerator.


#### Disclaimer:
Since I was a part of CodePath's Android University, I decided to create this app to practice what I learned and to learn new 
Android Development concepts. I appreciate any help or advice on how to make this application/code work better and any help
on the challenges I'm facing. This app is currently *unfinished*, but I will try my best to continue working on it to get a finished product.
My main goal is to learn more about Android Development!


## Below is my progress so far:


#### App Features:
- [x] Bottom Navigation between three Fragments (Shopping List fragment, card view of Refrigerator items, and Compose Fragment)
- [x] A Simple List to add items the user would like to buy
- [x] User is able to click on and update items they would like to buy
- [x] A card view of the different categories of food products in a refrigerator
- [x] Allow the users to add refrigerator items and their expiration date 
- [x] Allow user to view items added through the card view in their refrigerator


#### GIFS (*Will be Added*):


#### Features I would like to add:
- Add a notification for when item is expired


#### Challenges:
- I was stuck on how to pass the item added by the user to the Refrigerator Fragment to be able to add and save data to be displayed,
so I used a bundle to pass the data and open the Activity so the user could se that their item was added.
