App Description: Creating an app that helps keep track of items in refrigerator.

#### Disclaimer:
Since I was a part of CodePath's Android University, I decided to create this app to practice what I learned and to learn new 
Android Development concepts. I appreciate any help or advice on how to make this application/code work better and any help
on the challanges I'm facing. This app is currently UNFINISHED, but I will try my best to continue working on it to get a finished product.
My main goal is to learn more about Android Development!

## Below is my progress so far:

#### App Features

- [x] Bottom Navigation between three Fragments (ToBuy List, card view of Refrigerator items, and Compose Fragment)
- [x] A Simple ToBuy List to add items the user would like to buy
- [x] A card view of the different categories of food products in a refrigerator
- [x] When clicked on card each card view you can see sample data I created

#### Currently working on

- Implementing logic on Compose Fragment so it will directly add the users Refrigerator item and be displayed
- Trying to pass data from one fragment to another, so that I can add the item to particular list

#### Features I would like to add
- Allow user to add items to refrigerator based on category
  - Be able to add item and expiration date (using Calendar)
- Allow user to view items added through the card view
- Add a notification for when item is expired

#### Challanges
- I'm currently stuck on what I'm working on, which is how to pass the data added by the user to the Refrigerator Fragment to be 
able to add and save data to be displayed
